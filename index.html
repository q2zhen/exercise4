  <h1>Major-General's Song</h1>
  <h2>Gilbert &amp; Sullivan (1879)</h2>

  <p>
    I am the very model of a modern Major-General,<br>
    I've information vegetable, animal, and mineral,<br>
    I know the kings of England, and I quote the fights historical,<br>
    From Marathon to Waterloo, in order categorical;<br>
    I'm very well acquainted too with matters mathematical,<br>
    I understand equations, both the simple and quadratical,<br>
    About binomial theorem I'm teeming with a lot o' news---<br>
    With many cheerful facts about the square of the hypotenuse.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm very good at integral and differential calculus;<br>
    I know the scientific names of beings animalculous:<br>
    In short, in matters vegetable, animal, and mineral,<br>
    I am the very model of a modern Major-Gineral.
  </p>

  <p>
    I know our mythic history, King Arthur's and Sir Caradoc's;<br>
    I answer hard acrostics, I've a pretty taste for paradox,<br>
    I quote in elegiacs all the crimes of Heliogabalus,<br>
    In conics I can floor peculiarities parabolous;<br>
    I can tell undoubted Raphaels from Gerard Dows and Zoffanies,<br>
    I know the croaking chorus from The Frogs of Aristophanes!<br>
    Then I can hum a fugue of which I've heard the music's din afore,<br>
    And whistle all the airs from that infernal nonsense Pinafore.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then I can write a washing bill in Babylonic cuneiform,<br>
    And tell you ev'ry detail of Caractacus's uniform:<br>
    In short, in matters vegetable, animal, and mineral,<br>
    I am the very model of a modern Major-Gineral.
  </p>

  <p>
    In fact, when I know what is meant by "mamelon" and "ravelin",<br>
    When I can tell at sight a Mauser rifle from a javelin,<br>
    When such affairs as sorties and surprises I'm more wary at,<br>
    And when I know precisely what is meant by "commissariat",<br>
    When I have learnt what progress has been made in modern gunnery,<br>
    When I know more of tactics than a novice in a nunnery –<br>
    In short, when I've a smattering of elemental strategy –<br>
    You'll say a better Major-General has never sat a gee.
  </p>

  <p>
    For my military knowledge, though I'm plucky and adventury,<br>
    Has only been brought down to the beginning of the century;<br>
    But still, in matters vegetable, animal, and mineral,<br>
    I am the very model of a modern Major-Gineral.
